# There’s Something Wrong with How We See Galaxies

Created: November 26, 2024 3:43 AM

When we look at images of galaxies, we assume we’re seeing them as they are. In reality, we’re viewing a composite of stars’ positions from different points in time. Light from a galaxy millions of light-years away takes millions of years to reach us, and stars within a galaxy move over vast timescales. This means our view is a distortion—a snapshot of the past rather than the present.

# **The Challenge of Galactic Motion**

Stars within a galaxy orbit their centers at varying speeds. By the time their light reaches us, these stars have likely shifted positions. Mapping galaxies as they truly were when their light was emitted requires advanced astrometry and simulations to extrapolate their motions backward in time. Doing so could revolutionize how we understand galactic dynamics.

# **Rethinking Dark Matter**

Dark matter is thought to explain why galaxies hold together despite their observed mass. However, our distorted view of galaxies may affect calculations of their rotation curves—key evidence for dark matter. Correcting for the true positions of stars might challenge the need for dark matter or reveal new explanations for galactic behavior.

# What would it look like?

Well, I don’t have a fucking clue, but I’m guessing they’re not whirly-shaped anymore. It’s also possible they are. But we need to find out.

# **The Path Forward**

Reconstructing galaxies could provide clearer insights into cosmic evolution and challenge long-held theories. With AI, advanced simulations, and next-gen telescopes, we may soon see galaxies not as they appear to us, but as they truly were—and perhaps rewrite our understanding of the universe.

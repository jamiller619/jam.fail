Spring is a minimal new tab page for Google Chrome that
brings daily inspiration to your browser with a clean design
featuring a clock inspired by <a href="https://www.ziiiro.com/">Ziiiro</a> and curated photography
from <a href="https://www.unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>. What started as a simple idea quickly grew
into a full-stack project combining a native Web Component
frontend with a backend based on <a href="https://www.deno.com/">Deno</a>.

## The Concept

Spring is meant to do one thing well: deliver a
distraction-free start to each browsing session. When you
open a new tab, you're greeted with:

- A full-bleed curated photo from <a href="https://www.unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>.
- An analog clock face inspired by <a href="https://www.ziiiro.com/">Ziiiro</a>.
- No clutter - no weather, no widgets and no todo lists!

I wanted the implementation to be just as minimal as the
interface, so I kept the stack lean, modern and native
wherever possible.

## The Tech Stack

Spring is built as a Deno-based monorepo with two packages:

1. üöÄ `spring-api` ‚Äì A Deno server

At the heart of Spring is a rotating selection of Unsplash
photos. To handle this, I wrote a small API server using
Deno, which fetches and caches a new image at regular
intervals.

The API serves a single endpoint, which returns a
lightweight JSON object with a photo URL, photographer's
name and alt text. A simple caching mechanism prevents
excess API requests to Unsplash and ensures consistent image delivery.

2. üèµÔ∏è `spring-extension` ‚Äì The Chrome extension

The actual extension is a simple bundle that replaces the
browser's new tab page. It is made up of three Web Components:
- `<EpicUnsplash />`
- `<DateTime />`
- `<ZiiiroClock />`

Each Web Component includes an API via native HTML
attributes that control its various options. In addition,
the extension includes an Options page to allow overall customization.

### Why Deno?

If it wasn't for Deno, and their generous free hosting for
small apps, this project wouldn't be possible. Or, at least,
wouldn't be possible using Unsplash.

## Monorepo Structure

I structured the project as a monorepo using `deno.json` to
manage both packages from the root. This keeps versioning
consistent and simplifies local development.

```bash
/spring
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /api
  ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.ts         # Deno API server
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /extension
  ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html      # New tab template
  ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js          # Web Component logic
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deno.json            # Deno workspace config
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

## Final Thoughts

Spring is a small project that served a need when I couldn't
find a new tab page extension that I liked. As a designer
and developer, it encapsulates many of my current values:
minimalism, native APIs, composable architecture and a
thoughtful user experience. It's also a great example of how
modern tools like Deno and Web Components can be combined to
create something that is much easier to deploy and maintain ‚Äì without the weight of traditional frameworks.
